B. Research Questions
1. Research Question 1 (RQ1):
Companies with more LinkedIn followers have higher num-
ber of employees
Based on the findings, corporate organizations with more
number of followers on LinkedIn have more number of
employees, thus there is a positive relationship between social
media presence and size of the organization. The number of
followers in the LinkedIn often correlates with the companyâ€™s
market share, brand image, and reputation as the employer.
Large organizations are likely to have a lot of capital that can
be used to fund marketing and other activities that will make
their employees have many followers. This visibility not only
improves their image but also assists in the selection process
because the candidates will be attracted to the firms that are
well-known and easily found on the internet. Therefore, the
number of LinkedIn followers can be viewed as the scale of
a particular company and its capacity to attract and maintain
a large number of employees.

2.Research Question 2 (RQ2):
Locations with a higher concentration of companies
(Metropolitan cities) have more applicants
Big firms are established in densely populated areas for in-
stance in metropolitan areas; thus, they record more applicants
due to the availability of many opportunities within those areas
and the variety of sectors. These urban centers are generally
the large business hubs, which offer a multitude of sectors
and jobs that could be appealing to various individuals. Also,
the infrastructure is normally better in the large cities, wages
are higher and there are more contacts available. They are
also attractive in terms of recruiting talents from the same
area or from different parts of the world due to the existence
of big companies and start-ups. Thus, the centralization of
organizations in large metropolitan areas leads to a higher
traffic of applicants due to expectations of career advancement
and conditions of work.

3.Research Question 3 (RQ3):
Technical skills (like PYTHON, SQL) are more demanded
in companies with a higher employee count
The companies that have more employees require more
technical skills such as Python and SQL which indicates
that they handle more complexities and numerous operations.
These are important competencies for managing and analyzing
big amounts of information, creating complex software solu-
tions, and enhancing business operations. Larger organizations
might be in many fields and have diverse technological require-
ments; thus, it is helpful to know programming in Python and
database in SQL. Also, these skills assist firms in responding to
the changes, developing and innovating on their activities and
at the same time, maintaining their positions in the respective
sectors. Hence, the requirement of technical skills like Python
or SQL is often higher in the large org.

4.Research Question 4 (RQ4):
Companies in the AI industry prefer candidates with expe-
rience in ML and TensorFlow
That is why in the AI industry, companies are focused
on candidates with experience in machine learning (ML) and
TensorFlow as these technologies are at the core of creating
and implementing complex AI solutions. TensorFlow, an open-
source machine learning framework, shows a good understand-
ing of algorithms and frameworks that are crucial for training
and deploying of the AI models. To this end, organisations
look for these skills to improve and advance their AI, from
natural language processing to computer vision. Candidates
familiar with ML and TensorFlow are assets because they
help to reduce AI development time, enhance the predictive
modeling, and automate processes in numerous industries.
Hence, numerous firms in the AI industry ensure they recruit
ind. .

5.Research Question 5 (RQ5):
Higher Level positions require more skills
Management level positions in organizations usually require
one to have broader and more specific skills as compared to
junior level positions. Such positions not only involve technical
skills but also leadership, strategic vision, and decision-making
skills as well. Managers and executives are expected to have
good communication skills and interpersonal skills to manage
other people as well as have adequate problem-solving skills
to solve multifaceted business issues and grow the business.
In addition, they should show that they have adequate under-
standing of the industry and its rules, as well as financial skills;
